    <h3>What is a Self-XSS scam?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:22px;font-color:#777;margin-top:5vh;margin-bottom:5vh;">
         A Self-XSS scam on StoryBook tricks you into compromising your account by claiming to provide a way to log into someone else's
         StoryBook account, or some other kind of reward, after pasting a special code or link into your web browser. You might see
        this message on a friend's timeline after their own account was compromised by the scammer. Never click a link on StoryBook
        that goes to a website you don't know and trust. This kind of scam can often use your timeline to spread itself to your friends
        and may also include links to malicious software or suspicious websites. Learn how to recognize scams on StoryBook to protect
        your account from being compromised
